Devastating Earthquake Strikes Near Mount Valxa, Thousands Affected

North VPN HQ, Dranstan States — A powerful seismic event has shaken the region surrounding Mount Valxa, triggered by intensified magma movement beneath the volcanic structure. Geological experts confirm that the increasing pressure and shifting magma chambers within the mountain’s core led to sudden tectonic instability, causing a rupture along several fault lines. This phenomenon, which had been monitored for months, escalated rapidly, resulting in the catastrophic earthquake.

The tremor, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, struck with overwhelming force, sending shockwaves across nearby settlements. Residents reported violent ground shaking that lasted for over a minute, followed by multiple aftershocks. Officials have categorized the earthquake as one of the most severe in recorded history for the Valxa region, emphasizing its widespread destruction.

The humanitarian toll is staggering. Current reports indicate 7,000 fatalities, with 9 individuals still missing, as rescue operations continue. In the villages of Valxa and Vlaxla, 30 buildings have been either severely damaged or completely destroyed, leaving thousands displaced. Emergency response teams are mobilizing aid, while relief efforts prioritize locating survivors and stabilizing critical infrastructure.

Authorities are urging citizens to remain alert for potential secondary disasters, including landslides and further seismic activity, as the aftermath unfolds.
