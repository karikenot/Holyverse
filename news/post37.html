EZMR Emperor Regains Mobility After Advanced Surgery

Blackquare HQ, New Rodan City — After undergoing a groundbreaking surgical procedure, Emperor Maximus Eysilon Yazaoian has successfully regained movement following the replacement of his original bones with custom-engineered tungsten structures. The procedure, overseen by top medical professionals, involved integrating modified tungsten bones designed for optimal durability and compatibility with biological cells. Experts confirm that the transition was remarkably smooth, marking a significant milestone in medical innovation.

In his first public statement since the operation, the Emperor expressed his relief and determination, stating, "If I had chosen to keep using this hovering electric wheelchair, everything would have been unnecessarily complicated." He further explained that after spending seven days relying on his wheelchair, he now feels significantly more agile and comfortable in movement. His remarks reflect the confidence and resilience he has maintained throughout his recovery process.

With his newfound mobility, the Emperor has officially announced that he will personally officiate the coronation ceremony for Mornaki’s new monarch. His presence at the event is expected to reinforce the transition of power and symbolize unity between EZMR and its neighboring governance. As preparations continue, officials anticipate a grand and dignified ceremony to mark the beginning of a new era.
