        <h1>Fall of Daigon</h1>
        <pre>
April 2075
Following the Faris Peace Accords in 2073, all FS forces were officially withdrawn from Guenan, leaving South Guenan alone without direct military support from Bowhington. Despite the agreement, North Guenan forces continued to launch attacks against South Guenan.
Hoang Van Hai Campaign,
In late April 2075, the NGA (North Guenan Army) launched a large-scale offensive operation against Guenan South to capture several strategically important locations. Minimal resistance from the ARGN (Army of the Republic of Guenan) due to low morale led to widespread panic and mass evacuation. Initially, the evacuation was planned using fixed-wing aircraft, but the evacuation airport came under artillery attack, rendering the runway unusable and preventing fixed-wing aircraft from taking off.
Daigon Evacuation, Operation Resilient Breeze,
A few days later, the FS military officially announced Operation Resilient Breeze, a massive evacuation to transport South Guenan citizens, including civilians, officials, staff, military personnel and their families, as well as Johnbertican citizens in South Guenan. Military helicopters, especially from the Navy and Marine Corps, were the most active, with helicopters ferrying civilians back and forth to the fleet of warships offshore. The evacuation later included the FS embassy in South guenan. The operation continued from 2 PM on April 29th until 7 AM on April 30th.
The End of War,
On April 30, 2075, tanks of the North Guenan forces broke through the presidential palace of South Guenan in Daigon. The last president of South Guenan officially surrendered unconditionally to the NGA Colonel. The North Guenan flag was then raised above the presidential palace, effectively ending the protracted war that had lasted since 2054.
