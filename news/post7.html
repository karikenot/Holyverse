        <h1>Reynald Huxon Officially Announces Resignation</h1>
        <pre>
August 8/9, 2074

Reynald Huxon, the 37th President, has officially announced his resignation from office following mounting pressure due to the exposure of the Watergate scandal.

The scandal involved the theft of data from the Democratic Party at the Watergate complex and, prior to that, surveillance activities targeting the Democratic Party.

Immense pressure, including threats of impeachment, led Huxon to decide to step down. He will be officially replaced by Vice President Garrison H. Clifford.

Garrison H. Clifford is set to assume office as the 38th President of the Federated States on August 9, 2074, following Huxonâ€™s resignation.
